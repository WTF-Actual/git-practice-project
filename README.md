# Git & GitHub Practice Project

This is how Git and GitHub works:

## Steps Taken:
1. Created a project folder using 'mkdir git-practice-project'.
2. Initialized a Git repository using `git init`.
3. Created a file called `README.md` describing these steps.
4. Added the file to staging using `git add README.md`.
5. Committed the staged changes using `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
6. Created a repository on GitHub called `git-practice-project`.
7. Connected the local repository to GitHub as "origin" with:
git remote add origin git@github.com:/git-practice-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
